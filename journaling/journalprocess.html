                    <h1>HOW I JOURNAL</h1>
                    <p>* what a lot of bullet journalers tend to understandably forget is that the bullet journal system is customizable and flexible. what this also means is that you can frankenstein the bullet journal method and create your system made up of sewn together components of various other methods. </p>
                    <p>* if your primary goal with your notebook is feel more in control and present in your life, then it's important to view it as a second brain. it is reasonable to believe that not all brains work alike. when combining both thoughts, you can start to see the reason why many people who try the bullet journal method are unable to keep it up long-term. they try to be too rigid with the method. they expect themselves to create artsy complicated layouts that aren't actually conducive to their brain. they need to have the same notebook as other people, the same pens, the same supplies.</p>
                    <p>* but each of our minds work differently. when you believe that, then it becomes easier to accept that your notebook does not have to look the same as others to be successful. you aren't failing because you're unable to work with the system the way others do. it is the current system failing you, and that simply means it's time to tweak it and change it as necessary until it becomes more compatible with your brain. maybe the size of the notebook is the problem. or the type of paper. for example: i find that tall and skinny notebooks like the traveler's notebook work best for me. but maybe you prefer big a4 sized notebooks. i also refuse to work on anything that isn't grid paper. but maybe lined paper works better for you.</p>
                    <p>* for me, i use my notebook as a writer the way an artist keeps a sketchbook. </p>
                    <p><center><img src="../photos/journaling/hij01.jpg"></center></p>
                    
                    <p>* that means i don't play with the layouts unless it serves me. my creativity is expressed solely in the pages i want to be creative in, like when i'm writing fiction or sketching storyboards, but i am intentionally not creative and artistic in the basic setup. </p>
                    <p>* for the basic setup, i'm using a hybrid system of the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq">basic bullet journal method</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/NVXTcNYbs_Q?si=NTpocP_ogqUjpUks">the life hacker</a>. my intentions are to be mindful of the goals i want to achieve and keep some memory of each day. otherwise it feels as though the month has gone on without me and before i know it, it's the next month and i remember nothing of the past few weeks.</p>
                    <p>* i make sure to keep an index on the back of my notebook. i write down page numbers of pages i want to refer back to later.</p>
                    <p>* i start with a "one line a day" page:</p>
                    <p><center><img src="../photos/journaling/hij02.jpg"></center></p>
                    
                    <p>* that way, if i miss a few days, i can always try to catch up and write down a single line of what i remembered that day. i also tell myself it's okay to write "i don't remember what happened" on days where that happens. in a way, that also indicates something about that day - usually that i was too depressed to engage with my interests, and that's important to log.</p>
                    <p>* then i set up a basic monthly spread to track upcoming events, bills to pay, habits, tasks i want to do that month, and goals i want to achieve. i also added a d20 roll every day just for fun. if i really need the guidance, whatever i rolled that day determines how i go about with my day.</p>
                    <p><center><img src="../photos/journaling/hij03.jpg"></center></p>
                    
                    <p>* i also don't really treat it like a chore. i miss days here and there, but when that happens i just set the next day up and move on. this notebook is meant to serve me, not the other way around! </p>
                    <p><center><img src="../photos/journaling/hij04.jpg"></center></p>
                    
                    <p>* this notebook also serves as my commonplace book. if you've seen me occasionally tag posts as #commonplace, that's me saving posts to write down in my notebook. i love to save advice i appreciated, quotes that resonate with me, and other bits and bobs of information i'd want to re-read in the future.</p>
                    <p>* i also like to write down my thoughts on topics that interest me. it actually is one of my biggest passions and special interests: optimizing a notebook system for myself and helping others find their system. so if you flipped through my current notebook, you'll find rambles about notebook systems and how simply following trends is ineffective.</p>
                    <p>* hope this helps!! feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions!</p>
